## Foreword
Many figures for this presentation have been shamelessly taken or adapted from the
*[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book)* book, which is a great reference for everything git and is [open source](https://github.com/progit/progit2).

In this course we will try to use the modern, safer git commands, i.e.:

- `git switch <branch>` not `git checkout <branch>`
- `git switch -c <branch>` not `git checkout -b <branch>`
- `git restore <paths>` not `git checkout -- <paths>`
