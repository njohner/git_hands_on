- Github should be a central component in your work
  - [All master students and PhD students must have an electronic lab book](https://github.com/metagenlab/labbooks/wiki).
  - Store notes, scripts, jupyter notebooks (without output)...
  - Separate repository for larger projects.
- Workflow:
  - Work on a local branch (`initials/feature_descr`)
  - Push to github
  - Make pull request:
    - Comment if useful
    - Ask for review if useful
  - Merge PR and delete branch
